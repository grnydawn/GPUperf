Nvidia Nsight Tutorial - 0.Prerequisite
==========================================

1. Installing Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute on your local computer
    * Download the tools from : https://developer.nvidia.com/gameworksdownload#?tx=$gameworks,developer_tools
    * In case that above link is broken, try : https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems and follow proper links
2. Summit system account
    * This is needed for you to actually run exercise code by yourself.
    * However, without the account, you can still get much of the material by just attending the class
3. Some techniques related to GPU programming (optional)
    * We will use OpenACC for GPU programming in our exercise codes. However, only basic openacc things will be used in the class.
    * Similarly we have a simple CUDA code used for explaining GPU hardware usage
    * General idea of parallel programming is good to have such as threading, process, and openMP.
